# Postfix (SMTP)
#
# Postfix handles the transmission of email between servers
# using the SMTP protocol. It is a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA).
#
# Postfix listens on port 25 (SMTP) for incoming mail from
# other servers on the Internet. It is responsible for very
# basic email filtering such as by IP address and greylisting,
# it checks that the destination address is valid, rewrites
# destinations according to aliases, and passses email on to
# another service for local mail delivery.
#
# The first hop in local mail delivery is to Spamassassin via
# LMTP. Spamassassin then passes mail over to Dovecot for
# storage in the user's mailbox.
#
# Postfix also listens on port 587 (SMTP+STARTLS) for
# connections from users who can authenticate and then sends
# their email out to the outside world. Postfix queries Dovecot
# to authenticate users.
#
# Address validation, alias rewriting, and user authentication
# is configured in a separate setup script mail-users.sh
# because of the overlap of this part with the Dovecot
# configuration.

apt_install postfix postfix-pcre

# Disable greylisting for now.  Instant gratification matters more than
# fighting spam at this point.  Also see additional tweak below
# apt_install postgrey

# Basic Settings

# Have postfix listen on all network interfaces, set our name (the Debian default seems to be localhost),
# and set the name of the local machine to localhost for xxx@localhost mail (but I don't think this will have any effect because
# there is no true local mail delivery). Also set the banner (must have the hostname first, then anything).
tools/editconf.py /etc/postfix/main.cf \
	inet_interfaces=all \
	myhostname=$PRIMARY_HOSTNAME\
	smtpd_banner="\$myhostname ESMTP Hi, I'm a Mail-in-a-Box (Ubuntu/Postfix; see https://github.com/joshdata/mailinabox)" \

# Outgoing Mail

# Enable the 'submission' port 587 smtpd server and tweak its settings.
# a) Require the best ciphers for incoming connections per http://baldric.net/2013/12/07/tls-ciphers-in-postfix-and-dovecot/.
#    but without affecting opportunistic TLS on incoming mail, which will allow any cipher (it's better than none).
# b) Give it a different name in syslog to distinguish it from the port 25 smtpd server.
# c) Add a new cleanup service specific to the submission service ('authclean')
#    that filters out privacy-sensitive headers on mail being sent out by
#    authenticated users.

# Enable TLS on incoming connections (i.e. ports 25 *and* 587) and

# opportunistic TLS available on *incoming* mail.

# When connecting to remote SMTP servers, prefer TLS and use DANE if available.
# Postfix queries for the TLSA record on the destination MX host. If no TLSA records are found,
# then opportunistic TLS is used. Otherwise the server certificate must match the TLSA records
# or else the mail bounces. TLSA also requires DNSSEC on the MX host. Postfix doesn't do DNSSEC
# itself but assumes the system's nameserver does and reports DNSSEC status. Thus this also
# relies on our local bind9 server being present and smtp_dns_support_level being set to dnssec
# to use it.

# Incoming Mail

# Pass any incoming mail over to a local delivery agent. Spamassassin
# will act as the LDA agent at first. It is listening on port 10025
# with LMTP. Spamassassin will pass the mail over to Dovecot after.
#
# In a basic setup we would pass mail directly to Dovecot like so:
# tools/editconf.py /etc/postfix/main.cf virtual_transport=lmtp:unix:private/dovecot-lmtp
#
tools/editconf.py /etc/postfix/main.cf virtual_transport=lmtp:[127.0.0.1]:10025

# Who can send outbound mail? The purpose of this is to prevent
# non-authenticated users from sending mail that requires being
# relayed elsewhere. We don't want to be an "open relay".
#
# permit_sasl_authenticated: Authenticated users (i.e. on port 587).
# permit_mynetworks: Mail that originates locally.
# reject_unauth_destination: No one else. (Permits mail whose destination is local and rejects other mail.)
tools/editconf.py /etc/postfix/main.cf \
	smtpd_relay_restrictions=permit_sasl_authenticated,permit_mynetworks,reject_unauth_destination

# Who can send mail to us? Some basic filters.
#
# reject_non_fqdn_sender: Reject not-nice-looking return paths.
# reject_unknown_sender_domain: Reject return paths with invalid domains.
# reject_rhsbl_sender: Reject return paths that use blacklisted domains.
# permit_sasl_authenticated: Authenticated users (i.e. on port 587).
# permit_mynetworks: Mail that originates locally.
# reject_rbl_client: Reject connections from IP addresses blacklisted in zen.spamhaus.org
# check_policy_service: Apply greylisting using postgrey.
#
# Notes:
# permit_dnswl_client can pass through mail from whitelisted IP addresses, which would be good to put before greylisting
# so these IPs get mail delivered quickly. But when an IP is not listed in the permit_dnswl_client list (i.e. it is not
# whitelisted) then postfix does a DEFER_IF_REJECT, which results in all "unknown user" sorts of messages turning into
# "450 4.7.1 Client host rejected: Service unavailable". This is a retry code, so the mail doesn't properly bounce.
